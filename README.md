# SKELETON

This is a barebones project to use as a starting point for any TypeScript project that plans to use [NextJS](https://nextjs.org).

The only other opinionated thing installed here so far is:
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/).
- [Next Compose Plugins](https://github.com/cyrilwanner/next-compose-plugins)

Enjoy!

## Setup

Please make sure you have the following plugins installed for your text editor:

- EditorConfig
- Prettier
- ESLint

Run:

- `yarn`
- `yarn dev`
